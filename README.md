# Bank For All

this project is using angular as frontend and expressJS as backend

to run frontend locally please go to front-end folder and run `npm install` then `ng serve`

to run backend locally please go to backend folder and run `npm install` then `npm start`

both front and back have their own readme file. please refer to them for more information

###### note that there's a react frontend in the project but it's not used anymore due to my lack of framework knowledge lol

### to contribute, please feel free to make a pull request. we're currently working on business logic and database design right now. but can use extra hands on the frontend. especially the css side.

for feature request/milestone. please refer to the project board. we're using github project board to manage the project.
